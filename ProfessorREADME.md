# Persistence assignment in Rails

[Port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) your [persistence](https://github.com/cuny-nytech/persist) assignment to use Rails, within this repository. Just use it as a starting place – you are welcome to diverge from the original idea – but the important thing for this step is getting comfortable with Rails.

**Deploy the application to Heroku**, and **submit a pull request** to this repository. Include:

* All the necessary files
* In the README:
    * Setup instructions
    * A link to the live app on Heroku
