# Gabriela's Presistance with Ruby on Rails Website

website: https://floating-stream-9186.herokuapp.com/posts
github: https://github.com/gato333/persist-rails

this website is exactly like my persistance project which, 

created a small web app that is a small message board, like web app. That will take in posts from anyone, anywhere, as long as they have access to the webpage. It is supposed to be a pretend watergate website for any famous person. In other words you can pretend to be Obama, Whitney Houston's Ghost, Eisnten, a Kardashien, or etc and say whatever you want. The more ridiculous and funny the better. 

Upgrades are that you can edit, delete and view every post seperatly on their own page, regardless of who you are and who created the post (good and bad, really just an exersice to see if i could do it)
* this part still has some visual bugs but works well (except for teh destroy, not working)
